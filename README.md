# CCC Solutions

Canadian Computing Competition solutions in Python, C++, and Java.

I'm most comfortable with Python.
I've written some solutions in C++/Java just in case they have low time limits (C++ is faster than Java which is faster than Python).

My DMOJ username is savirsingh and my rank is top 300 out of 130K people.
